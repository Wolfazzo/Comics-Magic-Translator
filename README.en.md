|:--|:--|
| 🧠 **Text Extraction (OCR)** | Recognizes and captures original text directly from images, including balloons or irregular areas. |
| 🧹 **Background Cleanup (Inpainting)** | Removes the original text and automatically reconstructs the underlying artwork. |

# 🪟 Chapter 6 — Auxiliary Windows

In addition to the main panels, **Comics Magic Translator** includes several **floating and resizable auxiliary windows**, designed to assist in the translation process without cluttering the main workspace.

---

## 🖼️ Original Image Viewer

This window is an essential tool for **quality control**.  
It allows you to view the **original, unmodified page** alongside the active version in the *main canvas*.

### 🎯 Purpose

- **Direct Comparison:**  
  Displays the translated and original versions side by side, useful for checking fidelity and text placement.

- **Cleaning Verification:**  
  Helps ensure that the *inpainting* process has completely removed the source text without artifacts or smudges.

- **Retouch Reference:**  
  During manual retouching, it allows you to replicate textures and colors by observing the original in real time.

### ⚙️ How It Works

- **Opening:**  
  Open it by clicking **Compare with Original**, located in the application header.

- **Floating Window:**  
  Appears as an **independent panel** that can be freely moved by dragging its title bar.

- **Independent Navigation:**  
  Inside, the image can be:  
  - **Zoomed in/out** with the mouse wheel  
  - **Panned** by dragging with the left mouse button  
  These controls are independent of the main canvas, allowing you to zoom in on different areas between the two views.

- **Closing:**  
  Close it by clicking the **“X” icon** in the window header.

---

## 📝 Project Notes

The **Notes Panel** is an **integrated notepad** designed to record useful information during translation or typesetting.

### 🎯 Purpose

- **Translation Notes:**  
  To record specific terms, stylistic choices, or lines to review later.

- **Typesetting Reminders:**  
  Notes on fonts to use, alignments to fix, or areas to retouch.

- **Collaboration:**  
  In a team workflow, notes can be left for the **proofreader** or **quality checker**.

### ⚙️ How It Works

- **Opening and Management:**  
  Open it using the **note icon** located beside the canvas.  
  It’s a floating window that can be freely moved around the screen.

- **Creating Notes:**  
  Click **Add Note** to generate a new editable box.

- **Priority Levels:**  
  Each note can be classified as:  
  - 🟢 **Normal**  
  - 🟡 **Important**  
  - 🔴 **Critical**  
  The border color changes according to priority, providing quick visual recognition.

- **Automatic Saving:**  
  All notes are included in the `.cmt.zip` project file when using the **Save Project** function.

- **Import/Export:**  
  Notes can be exported to a `.json` file for sharing or external editing.  
  They can later be **reimported into the project**.  
  This feature is particularly useful for translators and typesetters working separately.

---

> 💡 **Tip:**  
> Keep the Original Viewer and Notes Panel open during final review.  
> They help ensure both visual and linguistic consistency throughout the chapter.
